**Ingredients**

Chocolate Cake
- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour ($0.27)
- 1 cup granulated sugar ($0.96)
- 1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
- 1 tsp baking soda ($0.02)
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder ($0.57)
- 1/3 cup cooking oil ($0.21)
- 1 Tbsp vinegar ($0.06)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)
- 1 cup water ($0.00)

Chocolate Icing
- 1.5 cups powdered sugar ($0.48)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder ($0.42)
- 3 Tbsp water ($0.00)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)

**Instructions**:

Chocolate Cake 
- Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder until well combined.
- Add 1 cup water to a liquid measuring cup, then add the vanilla extract and vinegar to the water.
- Add the oil to the bowl of dry ingredients, followed by the water mixture. 
- Stir until the chocolate cake batter is mostly smooth. Make sure no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.
- Pour the cake batter into an 8×8" or 9×9" baking dish. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake the cake for 35 minutes.

Chocolate Icing
- If using the chocolate icing, let the cake cool for at least an hour after baking before adding the icing.
- Wait until the cake is cool, then prepare the icing. 
- Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a bowl. 
- Begin adding water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a thick but pourable icing (about 3 Tbsp total). 
- If you let the icing sit, it may begin to dry, but you can add a splash more water to make it moist again.
- Pour the icing over the cooled cake and spread until the cake is evenly covered. 
- Slice the cake into 9 pieces and serve.
