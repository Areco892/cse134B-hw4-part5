**Information**: 
- Servings: 9 servings
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Cook: 45 minutes
- Chill Time: 4 hours
- Total: 5 hours

**Ingredients**
- 6 graham crackers ($0.44)
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar ($0.03)
- 3 Tbsp butter (unsalted, (melted) $0.37)
- 16 oz. cream cheese (room temperature, $3.26)
- 1/2 cup Greek yogurt (room temperature, (120g) $0.47)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g, $0.20)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.65)
- 2 Tbsp cornstarch ($0.09)
- 1/2 cup cold water ($0.00)

**Instructions**
- Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8×8 baking dish with parchment paper, making sure there is some overhang for easy removal.
- In a food processor, combine Graham crackers, brown sugar, and melted butter, and pulse until the mixture is combined but not too fine!
- Press crust mixture evenly into the lined 8×8 baking dish.
- Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.
- Meanwhile, using a hand mixer, beat the room temperature cream cheese on a low-medium speed until smooth. Add the Greek yogurt, white sugar, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
- In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Add this to the cream cheese mixture and mix until well combined.
- Pour the cream cheese filling into the baked crust, spreading it into an even layer. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the center is just a bit wobbly.
- Allow to cool completely at room temperature and then refrigerate for at least 4-5 hours or overnight, until completely chilled and firm.
- Once chilled, use the parchment overhang to lift the cheesecake from the pan. Slice into bars, serve, and enjoy!
